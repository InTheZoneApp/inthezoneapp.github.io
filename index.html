            "Knowledge workers work best by getting into "flow", also known as being "in the zone", where they are fully concentrated on their work and fully tuned out of their environment [...]. This is when they get all of their productive work done."<br>

            "When you have a long stretch when you aren't bothered, you can get in the zone. The zone is when you are most productive [...]. It's when you aren't interrupted to answer a question or look up something or send an email or answer an im."<br>

            <h2>What is the Zone?</h2>
            <div>
            The Zone is the state where you are completely focused and fully productive.<br>
            It takes time to get there, but the slightest distraction can knock you out of it and you have to start over.

            <h2>When to use this app?</h2>
            <div>
            Use this app when working on tasks that require uninterrupted focus.
            </div>

            <h2>How to use this app?</h2>
            <div>
            Tap when you start entering the Zone.<br>
            Tap when your get out of the Zone for any reason.<br>
            That's it!
            </div>

            <h2>How does this app work?</h2>
            <div>
            The screen color will change according to your Zone level.<br>
            Red indicates that you are out of the Zone.<br>
            Yellow indicates that you are in The Zone.<br><br>
            The timer indicates how much time you have been in the current Zone.<br><br>
            The app will automatically transition out of the Zone when you use your phone to answer a call, lock the screen, switch to another app, ...
            </div>

            <h2>How does this app help?</h2>
            <div>
            The act of launching the app and starting to get in the zone is a commitment to work. It can prevent you from procrastinating and is a good motivator to actually start working and to keep distractions away.<br><br>
            The timer can help you decide if it's a good time to take a pause because you've been in the Zone for a long period, or if it is better to continue working because you've just entered the Zone.<br><br>
            Your colleagues will notice the color change from yellow to red. This is a great signal that helps them understand the impact of interruptions on your productivity.<br><br>
            Statistics help you measure your daily productive time.
